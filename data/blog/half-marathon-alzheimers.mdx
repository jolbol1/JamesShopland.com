I'm dedicating this half marathon to my beloved grandmother who bravely battled Alzheimer's.{' '}

Alzheimerâ€™s Society is transforming the landscape of dementia forever.

Until the day we find a cure, we will create a society where those affected by dementia are supported and accepted, able to live in their community without fear or prejudice.

### My Progress

In my pursuit of the half-marathon, I'm following the tried and tested Hal Higdon's Intermediate Plan 1. For those curious about my progress, I'm sharing my Strava stats live on my website.
My primary goal? To cross the finish line. But, I'm also striving to complete the race within 2.5 hours.
