Ever find that your Javascript imports are getting messy. Particularly when you use a framework such as React where you are importing several components, utilities and third party libraries?

### Example

Today I'll show you a plugin you can use on top of Prettier to have your imports automatically sorted, in a completely configurable way. From this:

```tsx
import { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast'
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'
import { buttonVariants } from '@/components/ui/button'
import TextareaAutosize from 'react-textarea-autosize'
import { Icons } from '@/components/icons'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import { postPatchSchema } from '@/lib/validations/post'
import { Post } from '@prisma/client'
import Link from 'next/link'
import * as z from 'zod'
import '@/styles/editor.css'
import * as React from 'react'
import EditorJS from '@editorjs/editorjs'
```

To something you have configured, like this:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import Link from 'next/link'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

import EditorJS from '@editorjs/editorjs'
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'
import { Post } from '@prisma/client'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import TextareaAutosize from 'react-textarea-autosize'
import * as z from 'zod'

import { cn } from '@/lib/utils'
import { postPatchSchema } from '@/lib/validations/post'
import { buttonVariants } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast'
import { Icons } from '@/components/icons'

import '@/styles/editor.css'
```

## How To

Before we start, make sure [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is installed an setup.

### Installing

#### 1. Installing the Prettier plugin

To begin with, we need to install `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`

Do this using your package manager, pnpm, yarn or npm

```shell
npm install @ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports --save-dev
```

#### 2. Add the plugin to Prettier config

Next, we need to tell Prettier to use this plugin. We do this by adding to the prettier config. In my example the config is called `prettier.config.js` yours may be something different but that will not matter.

We need to add a plugins array to the config object and add `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`. If you have other plugins already, simply just extend the array.

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
  ...your config options
  plugins: ["@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports"],
}
```

### Configuration

Now that the plugin is installed, you would find that if you ran Prttier it would have some defaults, which is sorting imports alphabetically. This isnt what I want, so lets jump in to some basic configuration.

If you'd like to see more example, visit the documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)

#### Put specific dependencies at top

If we wanted to ensure specific imports are always at the top, for example react, we need to add another line to our prettier config, `importOrder`

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
  ...your config options
  importOrder: ["react", "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>", "^[.]"]
  plugins: ["@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports"],
}
```

This will match anything with react, and place it at the top. Next, any import not matched by one of these rules is placed where `<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>`, lastly `^[.]` will place any local import at the bottom.

Now when we run prettier, any imports with react in them will be placed at the top, such as:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import TextareaAutosize from 'react-textarea-autosize'
import { Icons } from '@/components/icons'
import { buttonVariants } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

However, this isnt exactly what I wanted, as you may notice `react-hook-form` has been sorted to the top too. To target specific imports we can utilise some basic regex.

To target react, and any import under react we can use this `"^(react/(.*)$)|^(react$)"`. This regex targets react exactly, and anything after the slash `react/nested`.

Lastly, I want a empty line to be placed under my react imports to keep things cleaner. To do this we can use an empty string in the array: `""`

For example

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
  ...
  importOrder: [
    "^(react/(.*)$)|^(react$)",
    "",
    "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>",
    "^[.]"
    ],
  ...
}
```

Now when we run prettier, we get this:

```jsx
import * as React from "react"

import { Icons } from "@/components/icons"
import { buttonVariants } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
...
```

#### Keep css at the bottom

If we wanted to ensure our css files are always at the bottom of imports, we can use the following regex: `"^(?!.*[.]css$)[./].*$", ".css$"`

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
  ...
  importOrder: [
    "^(react/(.*)$)|^(react$)",
    "", "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>",
    "^(?!.*[.]css$)[./].*$",
    ".css$"
    ],
  ...
}
```

#### Organising your own imports

In this next section, we are going to utilise the path section of `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json`. You can find out how to do this [here](https://dev.to/yteruel31/setup-a-path-aliasmapping-through-ts-config-1mlg).

Essentially, it allows your imports to go from `../../../components/Button` to `@/components/Button`

Once you have these set-up you can target them using regex like this: `"^@/components/(.*)$"`. This will sort all imports with `@/components/` where we want them. For example:

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
  ...
  importOrder: [
    "^(react/(.*)$)|^(react$)",
    "", "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>",
    "^@/components/(.*)$",
    ],
  ...
}
```

This will sort components at the bottom, like this

```jsx
import * as React from "react"

...other imports
import { Icons } from "@/components/icons"
import { buttonVariants } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { toast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
...
```

#### Full example

Now that you have learnt some of this cool techniques above, Im going to show you a full example that I like to use. This is from shadcn's [taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/taxonomy/blob/main/prettier.config.js) project.

```json title="prettier.config.js"
/** @type {import('prettier').Config} */
module.exports = {
  ...
  importOrder: [
    "^(react/(.*)$)|^(react$)",
    "^(next/(.*)$)|^(next$)",
    "",
    "<THIRD_PARTY_MODULES>",
    "",
    "^types$",
    "^@/env(.*)$",
    "^@/types/(.*)$",
    "^@/config/(.*)$",
    "^@/lib/(.*)$",
    "^@/hooks/(.*)$",
    "^@/components/ui/(.*)$",
    "^@/components/(.*)$",
    "^@/styles/(.*)$",
    "^@/app/(.*)$",
    "",
    "^[./]",
    ],
  ...
}
```

This is the config I used to sort the example at the top!
